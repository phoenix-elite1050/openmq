Provides a notification API for the MQ client runtime to inform an application about 
a MQ connection state changes.</P>

The current notification types defined for the MQ 4.0 release are as follows:
<UL>
	<Li>Connection closing event.  A connection closing event is generated 
	and delivered to the event listener if the broker is about to close
	a MQ connection (such as admin requested shutdown) and an event listener 
	is set to the MQ connection.
	</Li>
	
	<Li>Connection closed event.  A connection closed event is generated 
	and delivered to the event listener if the broker closed a MQ connection 
	(such as admin requested shutdown, restart, out of memory, etc.) and an 
	event listener is set to the MQ connection.	
    </Li>
	
	<Li>
    Connection reconnected event.  A connection reconnected event is generated 
	and delivered to the event listener if the MQ client runtime reconnected to
	a broker and an event listener is set to the MQ connection.
    </Li>
	
	<li>
    Connection reconnect failed event.  A connection reconnect failed event is 
    generated and delivered to the event listener if a reconnect attempt to a 
    broker failed and an event listener is set to the MQ connection. (MQ client 
    runtime will retry base on the reconnect contract).
    </li>
    
	</UL>
	
	<P>
    A MQ application sets a connection event listener in order to 
    be notified for the MQ events. The API to set the notification 
    listener is defined in the <code>com.sun.messaging.jms.Connection</code> class.
